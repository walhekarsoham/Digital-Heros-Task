## About the Project

A full-stack clothing e-commerce website where users can browse products, view product details, manage wishlist items, add products to cart, and complete checkout after login.
The project includes a React frontend with a Node.js and Express backend connected to MongoDB for user and cart data.

**Why I built this:**
I built this project to practice full-stack development, authentication, cart management, and building a responsive shopping experience.
